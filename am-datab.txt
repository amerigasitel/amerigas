Billing changes, convenience pay, collections, fees & rent, incorrect bill, invoice request, meters, payment arrangements, payment inquiry, refunds

= What do you think are some of the key aspects to evaluate when addressing Billing/AR cases

* Threshold = $100 / customer 
* Credit card or Credit balance.
* If bill is NOT paid: Dispute only



Complaints on the Late fee:
FI Dispute = financial dispute. Resolve by creation of an FI Credit Memo without any impact to material, quantity, rate or tax.

How to check:
SAP -> Invoice -> "Invoice" tab -> 


Fees & Rent = late fees
Incorrect QTY = Propane QTY

SD Dispute = Sales Distribution 
These are solved by creating an SD Credit Memo as they do have high impact to material, quantity, rate, or tax.
There is a single workflow approval process for both the dispute and credit memo.
Approval is done via Business workplace, on the individual credit memo which will auto close the dispute
